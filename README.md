# articlelist
This project shows how to use recycler view, retrofit using kotlin. Newyork times api has been used for creating article list.

I have used Retrofit client for api calling,
Kotlin for programming language,
Glide for image loading in list.
I have used MVVM architecture for this project as it is more clean and useable.

For the full article i have used webview and also for better user experience OnPageLoadingFinished event handler along with a progress bar so that user will know that web view is still loading the URL.
